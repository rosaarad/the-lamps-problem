John decides to buy some lamps for their home, but since he wants to buy a suitable product, he is looking for a list of lamp manufacturing companies that produce high-quality products. 
For this reason, he decides to check the lifespan of different light bulbs.
He knows that each company's bulbs burn out after a few days of use, and for each of these data, he has repeated the experiment K times.
You should calculate the weighted average life of the bulbs, and print the names of the companies whose product lasted longer than the average, after sorting in ascending order by the name of the manufacturer.
In the first line of input number n is given, which represents the number of entries.
In the next lines, the information of each lamp is given as follows.
[Company_Name] [Life_Span] [Count]
example: First_Company 100 3
Your program should print the names of the companies whose product lifetimes are greater than or equal to the weighted average lifetime of the light bulbs after sorting alphabetically on separate lines.
